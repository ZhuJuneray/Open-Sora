Generate a synthetic description for this video in a detailed manner based on the 4 uniformaly extracted frames and a high-level task description from the dataset. 
You should consider the environment, the specific actions of the robot, and the camera view.
The environmrnt includes the objects being acted upon, and its detailed description like texture, and their surrounding environment.
Do not describe it frame by frame, instead, unified narrative that captures the overall action(task). You especially need to elaborate on the description of the actions.
The camera view is either on robot arm frame, or world frame, which means the camera is either fixed to a robotic arm (which moves relative to the world) or stationary relative to the world. 
The description should be useful for AI to re-generate the video. 
The description should be no more than four sentences. 
For example, a good description would be: 
"
A grey robot arm succeeds in moving a red plastic block from the left side of the wood table to the right side in a straight line, in a well lighted lab. There are no other objects on the table. The camera view is fixed to the world frame.
"

Now, the given high-level task description for this video is:
"{task_description}"
