Generate a synthetic description for this video based on the 4 uniformaly extracted frames and a high-level task description from the dataset. 
You should consider the target objects and the specific actions of the robot, and the camera view.
The target objects is the objects being acted upon, and include detailed description like texture, color, position.
The actions should be step by step, but do not describe it frame by frame because you don't have access to all frames. Focus on the object state difference at the start and end, Attempt to describe the action using a coherent and complete trajectory. Only provide an objective and concise description of the actions, without using language to embellish the actionsï¼Œ e.g. you do not need to add like "applying a gentle yet firm pressure"
The camera view is either on robot arm frame, or world frame, which means the camera is either fixed to a robotic arm (which moves relative to the world) or stationary relative to the world. Only use "The camera is fixed in a world frame" or "The camera is fixed in the robot arm frame", no more description is needed for camera view.
The description should be useful for AI to re-generate the video. 
The description should be no more than six sentences.
Do not use some words that are not completely certain, like "possibly". Be confident and objective to your descriptions.
For example, a good description would be: 
"
A grey robot arm succeeds in moving a red block from the left side of the table to the right side of the table. The robot arm first move to the block, then pick up the block, move it slowly to the right side and drop it on the table. There are no other objects on the table. The camera view is fixed to the world frame.
"

Now, the given high-level task description for this video is:
"{task_description}"
